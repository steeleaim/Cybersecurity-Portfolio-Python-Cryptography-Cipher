# Cybersecurity-Portfolio-Python-Cryptography-Cipher

A simple exercise using python to encrypt and decrypt a message using python. In this instance, the cipher is a Caeser cypher implementing a displacement of the 26 alphabetic character by 3 places (shift = key % 26 and key = 3). It uses translation tables to map a character to its encrypted character and visa versa in the decrypt function.
